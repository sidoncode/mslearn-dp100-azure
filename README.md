# Azure Machine Learning Lab Exercises

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for Microsoft course [DP-100 *Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01) and the equivalent [self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/). The labs are designed to accompany the learning materials and enable you to practice using the technologies described them.

You can view the instructions for the lab exercises at **[https://aka.ms/mslearn-dp100](https://aka.ms/mslearn-dp100)**.



## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- If you have suggestions or spot any errors, please report them as [issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100/issues).

## Notes

### Classroom Materials

The labs are provided in this GitHub repo rather than in the student materials in order to (a.) share them with other learning modalities, and (b.) ensure that the latest version of the lab files is always used in classroom deliveries. This approach reflects the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform.

Anyone can access the files in this repo, but Microsoft Learning support is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
